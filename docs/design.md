# lolPing — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-10-01
**Status:** Implemented in v0.1.0

## 1. Purpose

A personal desktop toy for Windows that recreates League of Legends' ping wheel anywhere on the desktop. Hold the trigger key (Alt by default), drag, and a League-style ping wheel opens. Release on a slice to drop that ping, with its animation and its original sound, at the point where the wheel opened.

- **Audience:** a single user on their own machine. There is no networking or multiplayer.
- **Capture:** pings must appear in whole-screen capture (Discord "Screen", OBS Display Capture, screenshots). Single-window capture is not supported.
- **Success criteria:**
  1. Alt+drag opens the wheel over any normal app without that app receiving the drag.
  2. Releasing on a slice shows the ping with animation and sound with no noticeable delay.
  3. With the option off, Alt+click behaves as it did without lolPing.
  4. A hotkey turns everything on and off.
  5. The settings UI follows Fluent design.

## 2. Decisions log

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Platform | Windows 11 only, multi-monitor, mixed DPI (user has two displays) |
| Stack | Electron (TypeScript) + React + Fluent UI React v9 for the UI. A small native C++ helper handles global input. |
| Default trigger | Hold **Alt** and drag with the left mouse button to open the wheel. |
| Trigger + click (no drag) | Configurable, **off** by default. Off: the click passes through untouched. On: it places a **generic** ping and the click is swallowed. |
| Toggle | A global hotkey (default **Ctrl+Alt+P**) turns pinging on/off, mirrored in the tray. |
| Wheel slots | 8 slices, top then clockwise: Danger, Push, On My Way, All In, Assist Me, Need Vision, Enemy Missing, Enemy Vision |
| Excluded pings | Vision Cleared, Defend/Hold, Target, the yellow "caution" circle |
| Textures | Only standard textures. **Never colourblind (`_cb`) variants.** |
| Sound | Original League sounds, extracted from the user's local install |

## 3. Assets

The assets are already extracted into the repo and ship with the app. They come from the user's local League install and are © Riot Games. The project will be published on GitHub with the assets bundled; the owner accepts the risk and will take it down if Riot asks.

### 3.1 Ping table (single source of truth: `src/shared/pings.ts`)

| id | Slot | Wheel icon (`assets/textures/`) | On-screen art | Sound (`assets/sounds/`) | Ring colour |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `danger` | N | `pingwheel_retreatrender.png` | `pingwheel_retreatrender.png` | `SRP_12.wav` | `#ff3b55` |
| `push` | NE | `push.png` | `pingwheel_pushrender.png` | `SRP_9.wav` | `#35d27a` |
| `omw` | E | `omw.png` | `omw.png` (upright icon; the flat `omw` ground render looks wrong) | `OnMyWay.wav` | `#2e8bff` |
| `allin` | SE | `all_in.png` | `pingwheel_allin_render_01.png` + `_02.png` (two halves that clash together) | `SRP_4.wav` | `#f2b320` |
| `assist` | S | `assist_me.png` | `assist_me.png` | `ComeHere.wav` | `#56d43c` |
| `needvision` | SW | `need_vision.png` | `need_vision.png` | `SRP_7.wav` | `#56d43c` |
| `missing` | W | `enemy_missing.png` | `enemy_missing.png` | `MIA.wav` | `#f2c518` |
| `enemyvision` | NW | `enemy_vision.png` | `pingwheel_enemyvisionrender.png` | `AreaIsWarded.wav` | `#ff3b55` |
| `generic` | (trigger+click) | `generic_ping.png` | `pingwheel_basicpingrender.png` | `Base.wav` | `#2e8bff` |
| wheel tick | — | — | — | `button.wav` | — |

Unused extracted files stay in `assets/` but are never referenced: the `_cb` textures, `caution`, `hold`, `target`, `vision_cleared`, the `pingwheel_*` renders not listed above, and the other sounds.

### 3.2 Asset pipeline (already run; kept reproducible)

The extraction scripts live in `tools/extract-assets/`, together with a README. Each step:

1. **Textures:** DDS (DXT5) → PNG with Pillow.
2. **Sound banks:** read the WAD v3 table of contents with a small Python reader (Python 3.14 has built-in zstd). Names come from CommunityDragon's `hashes.game.txt` list, filtered to sound banks. The ping banks are in `DATA/FINAL/Maps/Shipping/Common.wad.client`:
   - `assets/sounds/wwise2016/sfx/shared/hud_global_events.bnk`
   - `assets/sounds/wwise2016/sfx/shared/hud_global_audio.bnk`
3. **Event → clip mapping:**
   - Event names (`Play_sfx_hud_base_Pings_*`) come from string search in the game's `.bin` files.
   - The bank's HIRC section is walked from event → action → layer container → sound → embedded WEM id.
   - The event id is the FNV-1 32-bit hash of the lower-cased event name.
4. **Decoding:** the clips are Wwise Vorbis (`0xFFFF`), decoded with `vgmstream-cli` (r2117).
5. **Mixing:** layer containers play their children at the same time. They are mixed with ffmpeg `amix` plus `alimiter` (limit −1 dB) to avoid clipping. Each file has at most 35 ms of silence at the start.

## 4. Architecture

└───────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why a separate helper process:**
- Only a low-level hook can swallow the Alt+drag so the app underneath doesn't drag or select text. Node global-hook libraries can only listen.
- Windows silently removes a low-level hook that responds slowly, so it can't live on Electron's busy main thread.
- A tiny dedicated process responds in microseconds and is isolated from renderer and GC pauses.

## 5. Hook helper

### 5.1 Input decision logic (pure, unit-tested state machine in `decision.cpp`)

States: `Idle`, `Pending` (trigger held + button down, not yet moved past the threshold), `Wheel` (wheel open).

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Disabled | Pass everything through; only the toggle hotkey is checked |
| Left button down while trigger held | **Swallow**, record the point, go to `Pending` |
| `Pending`, movement > `dragThresholdPx` | Send `wheelOpen{x,y}` with the *press* point, go to `Wheel` |
| `Wheel`, mouse move | Send `wheelMove{x,y}`. Movement is not swallowed, so the cursor still moves. |
| `Wheel`, left button up | **Swallow**, send `wheelRelease{x,y}`, go to `Idle` |
| `Pending`, left button up (trigger+click) | Option on: **swallow**, send `click{x,y}`. Option off: **replay** the down+up with `SendInput` (flagged as injected so the helper ignores its own events). Back to `Idle`. |
| `Wheel`, right button down or Esc | **Swallow**, send `cancel`, go to `Idle` |
| Trigger released during `Pending` | Treat as a plain click: replay it (or ping, if the option is on) |
| Trigger released during `Wheel` | Send `cancel`, go to `Idle` (the matching button up will still be swallowed) |
| Toggle hotkey | **Swallow**, flip enabled, send `toggled{enabled}`. If disabled mid-drag, also send `cancel`. |
| Watchdog: no mouse event for 10 s while in `Wheel` or `Pending` | Send `cancel`, go to `Idle` |

**Invariant:** for every swallowed button down, the paired up is also swallowed, or both are replayed. An app never sees an unmatched press.

### 5.2 Modifier side effects

- **Alt / Win menu activation.** Windows opens the menu bar (Alt) or Start menu (Win) when the key goes up without any other key in between. When a wheel or ping happened while the modifier was held, the helper injects a no-op "mask" key (`VK_NONAME`, 0xFC) before the modifier's key-up. AutoHotkey uses the same trick.
- **Caps Lock or a custom key as trigger:** that key's down/up is swallowed, so Caps state doesn't change and no character is typed.
- **Mouse 4 / Mouse 5 as trigger:** the side button itself is the drag button (press side button, move, release). A side-button click without movement is replayed so browser Back/Forward still works, or it pings if the trigger+click option is on.

### 5.3 Protocol (JSON lines, defined once in `src/shared/protocol.ts`, mirrored in C++)

All coordinates are **physical screen pixels**.

- **Electron → helper (stdin):** one *flat* JSON object per line (the helper's tiny parser accepts no nesting).
  - `{"type":"config","trigger":"alt"|"ctrl"|"shift"|"win"|"capslock"|"mouse4"|"mouse5"|"vk","triggerVk":N,"clickPing":bool,"dragThresholdPx":N,"toggleMods":N,"toggleVk":N,"enabled":bool}`
    - `toggleMods` is a bitmask: Ctrl = 1, Alt = 2, Shift = 4, Win = 8. `triggerVk` is used only when `trigger` is `"vk"` (custom key).
  - `{"type":"setEnabled","enabled":bool}`
  - `{"type":"suspend","on":bool}`: while the settings window is capturing a new shortcut, pass all input through and ignore the toggle hotkey.
  - `{"type":"shutdown"}`
  - Test mode only (`hook-helper.exe --simulate`, no OS hooks): `{"type":"sim","ev":"mdown"|"mup"|"move"|"kdown"|"kup"|"tick","btn":"left"|"right"|"middle"|"x1"|"x2","x":N,"y":N,"vk":N,"t":ms,"self":bool}`. After each one the helper also prints `{"type":"sim","swallow":bool,"inject":"down:left,up:left,…"}`.
- **Helper → Electron (stdout):**
  - `{"type":"ready","version":1}`
  - `{"type":"wheelOpen","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"wheelMove","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"wheelRelease","x":N,"y":N}`
  - `{"type":"click","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"cancel"}`, `{"type":"toggled","enabled":bool}`
  - `{"type":"error","message":"..."}`, e.g. a hotkey conflict, so the UI can report it
- **Lifetime:** if stdin closes (EOF), meaning Electron died, the helper removes its hooks and exits. The helper never outlives the app.

## 6. Electron main process

- **Single instance:** a second launch opens the settings window instead.
- **InputBridge:**
  - Spawns `hook-helper.exe` (bundled via electron-builder `extraResources`), parses its JSON lines, and sends `config` on start and on every settings change.
  - Restarts the helper with backoff (0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s). After 3 crashes within 60 s, it stops, sets the tray to a warning state and shows a toast.
- **OverlayManager:**
  - One `BrowserWindow` per display: `transparent`, `frame:false`, `focusable:false`, `skipTaskbar`, `alwaysOnTop` at level `screen-saver`, `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true)`, created with `showInactive()`.
  - Windows exactly cover each display's `bounds`. They are rebuilt on `display-added`, `display-removed` and `display-metrics-changed`.
  - Each event is routed to the overlay whose display contains the press point. A wheel near a screen edge may be clipped; it is not clamped, the same as in League.
- **Coordinates:** `screen.screenToDipPoint({x,y})` converts physical pixels to DIP, then the display's DIP origin is subtracted to get overlay-local CSS pixels. Wheel moves are converted relative to the *wheel's* display, even when the cursor crosses onto another monitor.
- **Toggle feedback:** tray icon state (normal or dimmed), the tray menu checkbox, and a small Fluent toast saying "Pings on" or "Pings off".
- **Startup:** "Launch at Windows startup" uses `app.setLoginItemSettings` with the argument `--hidden`. A manual launch opens the settings window; a `--hidden` launch stays in the tray.

## 7. Overlay renderer

### 7.1 Wheel (matches the in-game reference screenshot and `prototype/wheel-demo.html`)

**Geometry:** SVG centered on the press point.

| Part | Size / style |
|---|---|
| Center disc | radius 86 px, teal radial gradient, 3 px gold ring `#c8aa6e` |
| Ring | 8 wedges from radius 86 to 188 |
| Cardinal wedges (N/E/S/W) | extend to radius 288 with a fading gradient |
| Wedge dividers | thin gold-tinted lines |

- **Center content:** the generic-ping icon, a "PING" label in `#1fa9e0`, and a dim "BACK" hint with a right-click mouse glyph.
- **Icons:** 48 px at radius 137. Idle icons are desaturated gold (`grayscale(1) sepia(.75) saturate(1.3) brightness(1.15)`). The hovered slice shows the full-colour icon at 1.18× scale and a brightened wedge.
- **Selection:**
  - The slice is picked from the angle between the press point and the cursor, in 45° sectors centered on N, NE, …
  - A distance under 86 px means nothing is selected; releasing there cancels.
  - Moving onto a new slice plays `button.wav` at low volume, if the tick sound is enabled.
- **Animation:** opens with fade + scale 0.85 → 1 over 120 ms, closes with a fade.

### 7.2 Ping animation (as in the prototype)

The default duration is 3.2 s and scales with the "ping duration" setting. The art is drawn at "ping size" (default 110 px) and anchored so the ground ellipse sits on the press point.

1. **Pop:** scale 0.4 → 1.15 → 1.0 and fade in over 280 ms with an overshoot ease.
2. **Rings:** coloured rings expand 0.25× → 1.35× and fade over 650 ms, at 0, 220 ms and 1.4 s.
3. **Hold:** a gentle 5 px bob on a 1.6 s cycle, a coloured glow drop-shadow, and a soft coloured ground ellipse.
4. **Fade out** over the last ~13% of the duration, then the element is removed.
5. **All In:** the two halves slide in from opposite diagonals over 220 ms, then a white-to-colour flash and a 250 ms shake, then the bob.

Several pings can be on screen at once, and each is independent.

### 7.3 Audio

- **Decoding:** all ping and tick sounds are decoded once into `AudioBuffer`s at overlay load, with `AudioContext({latencyHint:'interactive'})`.
- **Playback:** each play is a fresh `AudioBufferSource` → `GainNode` (volume from settings). This removed the noticeable delay heard with `HTMLAudioElement` in the prototype.
- **Autoplay:** Electron's `autoplayPolicy: 'no-user-gesture-required'` keeps the context running without a user gesture.
- **No double sounds:** only the overlay that renders a ping plays its sound.

## 8. Settings

### 8.1 Schema (`src/shared/settings.ts`, versioned)

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | number | 1 |
| `enabledOnStart` | bool | true |
| `trigger` | `alt`/`ctrl`/`shift`/`win`/`capslock`/`mouse4`/`mouse5`/`{vk}` | `alt` |
| `dragThresholdPx` | 2–40 | 8 |
| `clickPing` | bool | false |
| `toggleHotkey` | `{mods, vk}` | Ctrl+Alt+P |
| `pingSizePx` | 60–220 | 110 |
| `pingDurationS` | 1.0–8.0 | 3.2 |
| `volume` | 0–100 | 70 |
| `muted` | bool | false |
| `tickSound` | bool | true |
| `launchAtStartup` | bool | false |

Changes apply live, with no Save button. Writes are debounced (300 ms) and atomic (write a temp file, then rename).

### 8.2 Settings window (matches `prototype/settings-demo.html`)

- **Window:** Fluent UI React v9 components, `backgroundMaterial: 'mica'`, theme follows Windows light/dark, Windows 11 caption buttons, left navigation (Trigger, Toggle, Pings & sound, Preview, App), Windows 11 Settings–style cards.
- **Status card:** at the top, a master on/off switch with a live hint ("Hold Alt and drag… · Ctrl + Alt + P to turn off"). Turning it off dims the dependent cards.
- **Trigger key:** a Fluent `Dropdown`, *not* a native select, with Keyboard and Mouse option groups plus "Custom key…", which captures the next key press.
- **Toggle shortcut:** a key-capture field showing keycaps. Click it, press a combination, and it rebinds; Esc cancels. A conflict reported by the helper shows inline and keeps the old binding.
- **Sliders:** drag distance, ping size, ping duration, volume. **Switches:** trigger+click ping, start enabled, tick sound, launch at startup.
- **Preview:** a tile per ping with its icon (no `_cb` textures). Clicking a tile plays that ping's sound and spawns it at the center of the primary display.
- **About:** version, asset notice, known limitations, asset problems, and "Open settings folder".

### 8.3 Tray

- **Left-click:** opens the settings.
- **Right-click menu:** Enabled ✓ / Settings… / Quit.
- **Icon states:** normal, dimmed (disabled), warning (helper failed).

## 9. Error handling

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Helper crashes or exits | Restart with backoff. After 3 in 60 s: stop, warning tray icon, toast, pinging paused until re-enabled. |
| Electron hangs or dies | The helper sees stdin EOF, unhooks and exits, so input is never left captured. |
| Stuck drag | 10 s watchdog in the helper sends `cancel`. Swallowed downs and ups are always paired. |
| Missing or undecodable sound | That ping is silent; logged and listed in About. |
| Missing texture | Fall back to `generic_ping.png`; logged and listed in About. |
| Corrupt `settings.json` | Back it up as `settings.bak.json` and use defaults. |
| Toggle hotkey conflict | Inline error in the settings; previous binding kept. |
| Display change | Overlays rebuilt; an active wheel is cancelled. |

**Known limitations** (listed in About):
- Elevated (admin) windows such as Task Manager don't receive the hook, because Windows blocks it, so the wheel can't be triggered over them.
- Exclusive-fullscreen games draw above the overlay.
- Single-window screen capture doesn't include the overlay.

## 10. Testing

- **Vitest (TypeScript):**
  - slice picking (sector boundaries at ±22.5°, dead-zone at 86 px, angle wrap)
  - coordinate conversion across two displays with different scale factors
  - settings defaults, clamping, migration, and corrupt-file fallback
  - ping table integrity: every referenced asset file exists, no `_cb` file is referenced
  - protocol message parsing
- **C++ unit tests** for `decision.cpp` (no OS hooks), as table-driven event sequences:
  - drag opens the wheel
  - click with the option on and off
  - trigger released early
  - right-click / Esc cancel
  - toggle mid-drag
  - watchdog
  - mask key emitted for Alt/Win
  - injected events ignored
- **Protocol integration test:** spawn the real `hook-helper.exe` in a test mode that reads simulated input events from stdin instead of installing hooks, and assert the JSON output.
- **Manual checklist** before calling v1 done:
  - Alt+drag over Chrome, Explorer, VS Code and Discord, with no text selection or menu bar activation
  - Alt+click with the option on and off
  - toggle hotkey while idle and mid-drag
  - both monitors at their real scale factors
  - pings visible in Discord "Screen" share and OBS Display Capture
  - kill the helper → it auto-restarts
  - kill Electron → mouse and keyboard are normal

## 11. Out of scope for v1

Multiplayer/sync, rebinding wheel slots, colourblind texture sets, per-ping volume, macOS/Linux, ping spam throttling, and a minimap.
